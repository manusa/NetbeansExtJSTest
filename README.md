# NetbeansExtJSTest

Netbeans HTML5/Javascript project test to learn ExtJS basic using Gulp as a build tool.

This is a personal project used to test and learn ExtJS. In order to facilitate
building process and dependencies the project will use Gulp and npm. I could use Sencha
Cmd, but I still really don't see the need.

## Functionality

For now, this projects generates a grid showing a list of my repositories.
